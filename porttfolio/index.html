            <h2>ABOUT</h2>
            <h5>My name is Neel Doshi and I am currently pursuing my 3rd-year Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering at LDRP Institute of Technology and Research. This journey of being an undergraduate student has been an amazing experience for me so far, as it has taught me to be more resilient and to develop an analytical approach towards problem-solving.

Academically, I have always been a curious learner and strive to improve my skills and knowledge in the field of computer science. During my time at college, I have actively participated in various coding competitions and hackathons, which have helped me to hone my programming skills, expand my knowledge-base and push me to think creatively out of the box. Additionally, I have also been an active member of various technical societies at college, where I got an opportunity to interact and network with like-minded people and learn from their experiences.<br><br>

Apart from academics, I am also a sports enthusiast, I have been an active member of the college badminton team. Being a part of the team has taught me the value of teamwork and has helped me in building a great camaraderie with fellow teammates. I believe that a healthy body leads to a healthy mind, which is why I always try to maintain a healthy lifestyle by dedicating some time to do regular exercise and yoga.

In conclusion, my journey as a 3rd-year student at LDRP College has taught me valuable life-long lessons, and I am extremely grateful for the learning opportunities that my college has provided me with. I strongly believe that the skills and knowledge that I have gained here at college will help me become a well-rounded individual as I step forward into the next phase of my life.</h5>

                <p>I developed a classic Tic Tac Toe game using JavaScript, showcasing my skills in DOM manipulation and event handling. I implemented the core game logic, including turn-based gameplay, win/loss/draw conditions, and a reset button. By dynamically updating the game board, I created a user-friendly and interactive gaming experience. This project highlights my ability to apply JavaScript concepts to build functional and engaging web applications.</p>
